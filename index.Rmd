# Overview {-}

This resource outlines the structure and content of our level 1 practical course at the School of Psychology at the University of Glasgow. We have developed these with a few key priciples in mind:

1. Pre, in-class and assessment. Each practical class, which we call labs in the timetable, has prep material for the students to read and work through whic forms the basis of the in-class activites which is in turn closely linked to the assessment. 

2. The assessment enables the students to demonstrate their competency of the skills learnt in class. However, we take the persepective of skills develop through practice therefore each assessment builds on the work not only completed in the associated lab but will include all the skills learnt to date over the previous labs. 

3. Live coding is an important part of our teaching. We structure our classes with a staff member leading with support from two Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs). This enables the staff member to lead the class through the content while the GTAs can ensure the individual students are being challenged and supported adequately.  

The overall goal for our students in our year 1 Psychology labs 
* To understand the current state of psychological science and what Open Science is as well as its importance
* To be clear on the importance of being confident and competent in data management 
* To be confident and competent at using RStudio as a tool to acheive good data management skills
